            Now, you will team up with one of the people you have been interacting with,<br>
            and will be solving a set of challenging logical problems as a team. You will<br>
            be randomly assigned to one of the following tasks:
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>spatial reasoning task,</li>
                <li>visual/perceptual task,</li>
                <li>logical reasoning task,</li>
                <li>mathematical problems task.</li>
            </ul><br>
            This problem solving activity is expected to foster engagement, improve communication <br>
            and encourage cooperation between teammates.
            <br><br>
            Some of you will be able to choose one person out of the three people as your teammate.<br>
            Some of you will be randomly assigned a teammate to work with.
            <br><br>
            The top two teams that complete the most problems will each win <br>

            <h3>Thank you very much for your participation in this study.</h3>
            The primary purpose of this study is to examine how a threat to one's sense of "honor" may influence may <br>
            influence goal-directed behaviors. We created the "Online team-building experience" as a cover story to <br>
            make the tasks we were asking you to do seem legitimate and realistic. In fact, all the other participants <br>
            you interacted with were not real but computerized hypothetical participants,and all the interactive elements <br>
            were simulated through predefined computer scripts. We were interested in how participants react to an <br>
            accusation of lying.
            <br>
            <br>
            Some participants received the feedback from one other participant who accused them of lying. Others <br>
            received the negative or neutral feedback instead of being accused. In fact, the feedback was pre-scripted <br>
            manipulation,not the actual response from other participants.
            <br>
            <br>
            We will examine the relation of the value scales you completed at the beginning, the emotion scales, and your <br>
            decisions of the teammate for the mathematical problems. The characteristics of potential teammates were <br>
            designed to measure your behavioral responses to accusation or other feedback and we expected that if you <br>
            were accused, you would be less likely to choose the best candidate compared to other conditions.
            <br>
            <br>
            We are truly sorry that we had to create a study that involved misleading information, but we hope you <br>
            understand that to avoid raising suspicion, it was necessary to use a misleading cover story. We also want <br>
            to reassure you that all your responses will remain completely confidential. No identifying data will be <br>
            maintained with your data.

                If we told our participants the true purpose of the study, people would probably <br>
                not respond as they would in real life. Please do not tell other students the true <br>
                purpose of the study. If participants know, for example, that the other participants <br>
                do not exist, we won't get useful results. If someone asks you what the studies are <br>
                about, you might tell them that it is online teambuilding activities involving completing <br>
                scales and several forms of interactions with other participants.
                <br>
                <br>
                We hope that this research will contribute to our understanding of how people emotionally <br>
                and behaviorally respond to threats to their honor.
